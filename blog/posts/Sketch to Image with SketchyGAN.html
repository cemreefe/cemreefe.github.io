<p>In this project, we implemented SketchyGAN, an image-to-image GAN model that allowed for non-pixel-to-pixel transformations which was novel at the time. We followed the paper and implemented the model in Keras instead of TensorFlow as the paper did.</p>
<p>This was a project that I led during the first batch of Applied AI projects run at <a href="https://inzva.com/">@inzva</a>, where I had previously studied Deep Learning extracurricularly. Our team was the only team consisting of undergraduate students, and we were kind of a test sample :-). Suffice to say, inzva kept on taking undergrads into the program afterwards.</p>
<p>We have shared our presentation and images in our GitHub repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>See our <a href="https://github.com/inzva/sketch-to-photograph-with-GANs">GitHub repo</a> for the implementation.</li>
