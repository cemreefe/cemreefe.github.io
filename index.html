<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I'm Cemre, a computer engineering graduate from Boğaziçi University with a keen interest in linguistics and languages. I have experience working on Deep Learning and Machine Learning projects and I'm currently working as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. My recent work has focused on Network Infrastructure and distributed systems. You can check out some of my past projects on the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> tab.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p>Apart from my professional pursuits, I also enjoy learning new languages and currently, I'm working on improving my French and Korean. I'm also passionate about analog and digital photography, though I haven't been able to pursue this hobby as much as I'd like recently. You can find some of my sketches on the <a href="misc.html">misc</a> tab.</p>
