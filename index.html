<p>A few months ago, after getting frustrated with a few popular RSS readers online, I decided
I could create my own RSS reader (as you do).</p>
<p>My main points of frustration were that; these tools were either completely paywalled, had free tiers
that would beg you to get the premium at every chance, or were a pain to operate.</p>
<p>I wanted something that would just get the job done: show me posts from feeds I follow. Give me
a clean UI to go through them, be completely free to run and use, and not have any unnecessary
distractions.</p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>Ever felt frustrated when a chatbot loses context after you explore a side topic? Current LLM (Large Language Model) conversation models are limited by their linear structure, which hinders context preservation and flexibility in branching and merging conversations. To overcome this, I propose a graph-managed LLM conversation approach, allowing for broader discussions with specific side topics while maintaining the full context.</p>

<b>What is Vercel?</b>
<p>First, a short introduction. Most people know Vercel as a front-end solution, however Vercel introduced many new features recently that make it a powerful tool for running small webapps <strong>for free</strong>. If you know what vercel is and why you want to deploy your project to vercel, skip here.</p>
<p>Vercel is a platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage modern web applications. Having tested it myself, I can vouch for the fact that once integrated, it is quite simple to use. With Vercel, developers can simply push their changes to their GitHub repository, and the platform will automatically redeploy the site and update the server with the new code (CI/CD Anyone?). The platform also provides a dashboard for each site, offering insights into status, recent deploys, and domain information. </p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>

<b>What is immutability?</b>
<p>Immutability is a concept in computer science and programming that refers to the property of an object or data structure being unable to be modified or changed after it is created. In immutable systems, once an object is created, its state cannot be altered. Instead, if a change is needed, a new object or data structure is typically created with the desired changes, leaving the original object unchanged. Immutability is often valued for its benefits in maintaining data integrity, simplifying code, and enhancing concurrency in multi-threaded applications. Immutable objects are commonly used in functional programming and in scenarios where predictability and consistency are crucial.</p>

I found it tedious to create an image file for each emoji, so I created this website to solve that problem. It's a static website that serves emojis as <code>.png</code> files, making it easy to use them as favicons.</p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>

<p>Most used 100 words in a language make up approximately 50% of words in a corpus (This of course varies from language to language. E.g. it is lover in agglutinative languages).

<p>In this project, we implemented SketchyGAN, an image-to-image GAN model that allowed for non-pixel-to-pixel transformations which was novel at the time. We followed the SketchyGAN paper and implemented the model in Keras instead of TensorFlow as the paper did.</p>
<p>Read about our project from inzva:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having graduated from the ‚Äújunior position‚Äù they were assigned to in the previous batch of AI Projects, undergraduates from Boƒüazi√ßi University, Cemre Efe Karaka≈ü and Eyl√ºl Yal√ßƒ±nkaya, along with another undergraduate from Istanbul Technical University, Burak Bek√ßi, a previous participant in our Applied AI Study Group, had one of the most acclaimed presentations in AI Projects history as they showcased a very fun way to implement GANs by turning their faces into sketches. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58a59506414fb5112de476f0/1574107592980-68XHGMJJR6ETRH1XBPEG/ai-projects-3-team3.png"/></p>
<p>The purpose of this project was to convert a sketch image into an actual image. A GAN architecture is used since this is an image-to-image translation problem. The team first wanted to replicate the results of their reference paper, SketchyGAN [1]. This special GAN architecture contains the masked residual unit (MRU) as a novel component. Apart from the traditional convolutions and the features obtained from them, MRU layer takes downsampled and upsampled versions of the actual images as input during the encoding and decoding part in the generator. Apart from this novel architecture, SketchyGAN also use extra loss terms added to the original GAN loss, such as perceptual loss and diversity loss. The team showed their results by also presenting their own sketches translated into actual images. </p>

<p>In this project, we aimed to explore the feasibility of using trigger word detection models to predict earthquakes. We were fortunate to have the guidance and expertise of a senior engineer from Is Bankasi, who provided valuable insights and guidance throughout the project. This project was part of Inzva's Applied AI Projects, which aims to give hands-on experience to aspiring data scientists and machine learning engineers.</p>
<p>To accomplish our goal, we used Andrew Ng's trigger word detection model, which is a widely used approach in the field of natural language processing. We adapted this model to listen to audio recordings of seismic activity continuously and output a higher value when the waveform suggests that the last waves might have been formed by the trigger word. Our hypothesis was that the preceding waves in the recording could provide information about the time to failure, allowing us to predict an earthquake.</p>
<p>We were excited to participate in a Kaggle competition where we applied our model to predict the timing of earthquakes based on seismic activity. The competition was a challenge, as we were working with a large dataset of around 610 million points, making data processing and training time-consuming. Despite these challenges, our team was able to place in the top 11% of participants, which was a great achievement for our first deep learning project.</p>
