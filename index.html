			<h2>hi there</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my small space on the web.</p>
			<p>I always wanted to have my own little space on the web that I can write on and edit freely. I took the opportunity when I found out about github pages. I will try to write about everything that interests me, including topics ranging from Computer Science & AI to Arts & Languages. Feel free to have a look around. I really hope the pages have some content when you see this, since now it is basically empty.</p>
			<p style="text-align:right"><i>13.09.2019</i></p>
			<p>Sadly, as of today, it is still empty. However if you are reading this in a distant time, we are in the midst of the Covid-19 outbreak (hey, just 5 "official" cases in Turkey so far!). All schools have been cancelled for 3 whole weeks. I am hoping to get this webpage going since I'll have a lot of free time on my hands. </p>

			<h2>who am i?</h2>
			<p>The name is Cemre, I'm interested in computers, linguistics & languages. I'm a computer engineering student at <a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index">Boğaziçi University</a>. I work on Deep Learning & Machine Learning. I also want to learn more about GameDev, Android Development and possibly AR-VR. For my projects, you can refer to the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> tab.</p>

			<h2>what do i do?</h2>
			<p>Just trying to survive in the pandemic, without failing my classes. I have several hobbies, I picked up drawing & language learning. As for the languages, I'm currently learning French & Korean. The former I know a fair amount but I still have a long way to go for the latter. And for the drawings, I might actually upload some on the <a href="misc.html">misc</a> tab up there. I also love both analog & digital photography even though I don't go out to shoot nowadays.</p>
