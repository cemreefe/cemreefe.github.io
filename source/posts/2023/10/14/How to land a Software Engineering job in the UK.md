### 1.1 Linkedin 

**Searches**

Every 2-3 days I would go on LinkedIn to check positions in the UK that may be recommended to me by the LinkedIn algorithm. 

**Alerts**

Additionally I had email alerts active. If you driectly create an alert, the LinkedIn UI gives you a not very fine-grained set of choices for your alerts. Instead what you can do is creating alerts for specific searches. I had alarms set up for a bunch of searches for a while before landing my position.

Let's first go through search fields one by one:

1. ðŸŸ¢ Text Query: This is the query you search for initially when you begin your LinkedIn search. I had alerts with the query field set to `Software`, `Data Scientist`, `Machine Learning`. This field will depend on your specialisation but it is always wise to have one with `Software` to cover most bases.
2. ðŸŸ¢ Date Posted: Best to keep this in line with your alert's period. i.e. if you have daily alarms, include last 24 hours.
