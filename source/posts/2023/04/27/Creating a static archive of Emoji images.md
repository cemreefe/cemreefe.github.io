# Creating a static archive of Emoji images

Introducing [Emoji.dutl.uk](https://emoji.dutl.uk): A Simple Website that Serves Emojis as Images

Emojis have become a part of our daily communication on social media, messaging apps, and other digital platforms. However, when you need the emoji in image format, you might have to follow several steps to obtain a usable image. That's where [Emoji.dutl.uk](https://emoji.dutl.uk) comes in.

As the creator of [Emoji.dutl.uk](https://emoji.dutl.uk), I wanted a simple solution to serve emojis as images on my websites. I found it tedious to create an image file for each emoji, so I created this website to solve that problem. It's a static website that serves emojis as `.png` files, making it easy to use them as favicons.

Using [Emoji.dutl.uk](https://emoji.dutl.uk) is straightforward. You can choose the emoji you want to use, such as the dolphin emoji (üê¨). Then, you can go to the website and enter the following URL: [https://emoji.dutl.uk/png/128x128/üê¨.png](https://emoji.dutl.uk/png/64x64/üê¨.png). This will generate a 64x64 pixel image of the dolphin emoji that you can download and use as your favicon. In fact, this website uses Emoji.dutl.uk to fetch its favicon!

The website is simple and easy to navigate. Emojis are listed alphabetically, and you can also use the search function to find a specific emoji by name or keyword. You can download the emojis in different sizes as per your requirement.

One of the best things about [Emoji.dutl.uk](https://emoji.dutl.uk) is that it is a static website. It loads quickly, and you don't have to worry about it being slow or unavailable. There are no ads or pop-ups to distract you from finding the emoji you need.
