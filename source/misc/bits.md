The monospace web, a design manifesto: <https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web>

I've seen this quite a few times by now in tech. The engineering team has a product/service/library that was implemented/employed earlier, 
had a lot of problems. It was never prioritized and is deemed utterly unfixable. The team then starts having problems that can be solved 
if that specific _thing_ was better. If it had better coverage, if it had better devx, if it was faster, if it was easier to deploy.
They talk about re-writing it, replacing it, getting rid of it and starting clean slate. 

Good, seasoned engineers come in, they say; We have something readily available to us, fixing this would be easier than rewriting everything from scratch.
They were right in many instances I witnessed, as much as we don't like the meaning of that. There is usually no value in reinventing the wheel, and
restoring an old obsolete system to its former glory is tedious but often rewarding.

Jetbrains failed me today. I was looking for a way to focus to the found result when I'm going through search results on CMD+Shift+F, and back to the query form the result, without using my 🐁. Aparently there's no way for it, and it doesn't seem to be coming any time soon!
This issue on [youtrack.jetbrains](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-49949/Allow-keyboard-navigation-in-Find-in-files-dialog) is asking for guidance, and [this one](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-49949/Allow-keyboard-navigation-in-Find-in-files-dialog#focus=Comments-27-8679798.0-0) explains the usecase pretty well.

I recently learned that the builtin `sum` function in Python uses `__radd__` rather than the more conventional `__add__`. Because the builtin sum has a default argument as its 
start value, an integer 0, the custom type that you want to use with the builtin `sum` needs to implement `__radd__`. 

That makes sense. Especially when you consider not all operators are [commutative](https://www.britannica.com/science/commutative-law#:~:text=commutative%20law%2C%20in%20mathematics%2C%20either,%2B%20a%20and%20ab%20%3D%20ba.). You can implement `__r(...)__` for any operator.
But under what conditions say, `__rmul__` is called? 

[This here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5182501/20867704) is a good explanation of that from stackoverflow.

You do not have to do the double-loop in python to flatten a list!
```
a = [[1,2,3],["a"], [0,3.9]]
(element for _iterable in a for element in _iterable) ~~ itertools.chain.from_iterable(a)
```

>It states that every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both. In other words, asking a question should not change the answer.[1] More formally, methods should return a value only if they are referentially transparent and hence possess no side effects. ー [Wikipedia: Command–query separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation)

If you're using _[hexagonal architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software))_ and trying to debug an issue, but everything from your business logic seems to work fine; take a step back and check your adapters.

Quoting Taylor Troesh — <https://taylor.town/my-superintelligence>

> Of course, trusting superintelligent advice is the smart strategy. But I wouldn’t need the advice if I was smart, would I?

> If I’m smart, I’ll listen to those machines. I’ll feed them all the available data/context. I’ll confide in them all the truths that I couldn’t bear to speak aloud. I’ll ask them what to do next: now, tomorrow, 5 years from now, ad finitum. I’ll ask them exactly how to become myself, or maybe trust them enough to become somebody else entirely.

I’ll engage in honest conversation. I’ll get educated. I’ll get help. I’ll help others. I’ll do boring stuff. I’ll exercise patience. I’ll focus. And I’ll probably start tomorrow-ish.

RT from [@simonwillison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/16/lessons-learned/): When you deliver work you’re really proud of, you’ve almost certainly done too much and taken too long. I have a bit of a perfectionist streak. I want to do my work well and thoroughly. It took me a long time to learn that when I do that, it’s for me, not for the company. When I’ve reached 60-80% of the thing being as good as I want, I’ve probably done enough. — Jim Grey

I have been following Simon Willison for a while. They are quite opinionated on software, which I like. You may not know them, but you may know their work. They are one of the main developers of Django. I quite enjoyed their talk at PyCon24: <https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/14/pycon/> where they demistify concepts around LLMs.
