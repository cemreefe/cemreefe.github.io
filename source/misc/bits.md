RT from [@simonwillison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/16/lessons-learned/): When you deliver work you’re really proud of, you’ve almost certainly done too much and taken too long. I have a bit of a perfectionist streak. I want to do my work well and thoroughly. It took me a long time to learn that when I do that, it’s for me, not for the company. When I’ve reached 60-80% of the thing being as good as I want, I’ve probably done enough. — Jim Grey

I have been following Simon Willison for a while. They are quite opinionated on software, which I like. You may not know them, but you may know their work. They are one of the main developers of Django. I quite enjoyed their talk at PyCon24: <https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/14/pycon/> where they demistify concepts around LLMs.
