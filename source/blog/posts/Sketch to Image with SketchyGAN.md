# SketchyGAN: Image-to-Image GAN Model

In this project, we implemented SketchyGAN, an image-to-image GAN model that allowed for non-pixel-to-pixel transformations which was novel at the time. We followed the paper and implemented the model in Keras instead of TensorFlow as the paper did.

This was a project that I led during the first batch of Applied AI projects run at [@inzva](https://inzva.com/), where I had previously studied Deep Learning extracurricularly. Our team was the only team consisting of undergraduate students, and we were kind of a test sample :-). Suffice to say, inzva kept on taking undergrads into the program afterwards.

We have shared our presentation and images in our GitHub repository.

- See our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/inzva/sketch-to-photograph-with-GANs) for the implementation.
