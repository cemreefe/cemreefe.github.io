# Typ-o and Typ-v: Foreign keyboard writing practice game

typ-o is a simple js-based web application that allows you to type in the standard Russian Cyrillic input method, while highlighting the keys you press.

I wrote it on a Thursday night after I couldn't find one that highlighted the pressed keys and was frustrated.

I plan to implement a simple game-based practice mode too, that's future work. (done!) Check [typ-o](/blog_source/projects/typ-o.html) out!

**UPDATE:** I made [typ-v](/blog_source/projects/typ-v.html), which has a **game mode**. It does not have a virtual keyboard support (I found it quite limiting, and hard to make cross-platform compatible.)
