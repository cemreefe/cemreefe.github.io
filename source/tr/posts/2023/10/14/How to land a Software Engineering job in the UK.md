# İngiltere'de iş bulmak (bilgisayar mühendisleri için)

![Yazın Primrose Hill manzarası](./primrose-hill.jpeg)

Üniversite'de son yılımda **Amazon Prime Video**'den iş teklifi alarak, mezun olduktan 3 ay sonra 2022 Mayıs'ta İngiltere'ye taşındım. İki yıl kadar orada çalıştıktan sonra geçtiğim Rippling şirketinde bilgisayar mühendisi olarak çalışmaya devam ediyorum.

Burada zaman geçirdikten ve yurtdışında çalışmak isteyen genç türklerle konuştuktan sonra bu sürecin çok fazla bilinmeyenlerle dolu olmasının bir çok kişiyi korkutup kaçırdığını fark ettim. Ben de süreci iki kez yaşamış birisi olarak Türkiye'den İngiltere'ye gelmek ve İngiltere'den çalışma izni almak isteyen isteyen bilgisayar mühendisleri için bir rehber oluşturması amacıyla bu yazıyı yazmaya karar verdim.

[TOC]

## 1. Ne nedir

- **Vize Sponsorluğu**: Vize sponsorluğu, bir şirketin, potansiyel bir elemanın İngiltere'de çalışma vizesi alma sürecine destek olmasına deniyor. İngiltere çalışma izni olmayan bir türk vatandaşının bu izni almasının <s>üç</s> iki yolu var (<s>Ankara antlaşması</s>, Skilled Worker (_Kalifiye Eleman_) Vizesi & Global Talent (_Uluslararası Yetenek_) Vizesi). _Skilled Worker_ vizesini almanız için bir şirketin size sponsor olması ve sizin vize masrafınızı karşılaması gerekiyor. Ayrıca şirketiniz size bir göç ajansı'nın desteğini saplayarak işinizi kolaylaştırabiliyor. _Global Talent_ vizesinde kendinizi sponsorlayabiliyorsunuz fakat bu vize türü çok daha az ve küresel ölçüde yeterliliğini kanıtlamış kişilere veriliyor (Bu vizeyi almış bir arkadaşımı ikna edebilirsem bu konuda bir post yazdırıp buraya ekleyeceğim).

- **Rolling Admission**: Rolling admission (_Sürekli işe alım_), bazı şirketler tarafından kullanılan bir işe alım yöntemidir. Pozisyonlar ilan edildikten sonra süreç her potansiyel işçi için ayrı ayrı işler. Yani önce herkesin özgeçmişleri toplanıp, herkesi eleyip, herkesi mülakata çağırıp adım adım ilerlemek gibi bir durum, rolling admission'da yoktur. Onun yerine, bir yarış gibi, ilk başvuranın özgeçmişi ilk incelenir. Daha sonra uygunluğunu en erkene veren çalışan ilk mülakata girer. Ve doldurulması gereken 5 pozisyon varsa, pozisyonların 5i de dolana kadar işe alım süreçleri devam eder. Bunun anlamı şirketler için tüm elemanlara bakıp en iyisini seçemeyecekler demektir. "Yeterince iyi" olanlar işe alınır. Adaylar içinse bu şu demektir: Ne kadar erken başvurursanız, şansınız o kadar yüksek.

## 2. Açık bir pozisyon bulmak

Recently, the job market hasn't really been the best. Finding job openings can be tiresome and locating job offers that do offer visa sponsorship is not easy as companies do not always include this in their job listings. Let me list what I tried and what I ended up doing.

Malesef tüm şirketler açtıkları iş ilanlarında vize sponsorluğu yapıp yapmadıklarını yazmıyorlar. Bunun çevresinden dolanmak için yaptığım bazı şeyleri aşağıda listeledim.

Açık pozisyonların nasıl bulunacağı konusuna derinlemesine girmeden önce, şirketlerin çoğunun **rolling admisson** ile işe alım yaptığını tekrar belirtmek istiyorum. Bu yüzden pozisyonlara **olabildiğince erken başvurmalısınız**. Bu gerçekten işe alınmanız için en öneml faktörlerden biri. En basitinden 1 haftadır duran ilanlara başvurmasanız da olur.

Bu sebeple özgeçmişiniz hep hazır ve güncel olsun, hep ulaşabileceğiniz bir yerde (drive) dursun. İlanları gördüğünüz anda başvurun.

Gelelim süreçte yaptıklarıma:

### 2.1 Linkedin 

**Profil Lokasyonu**

Öncelikle profil lokasyonunuzu İngiltere'ye hatta Londra'ya değiştirin. Bu yetenek avcılarının (_head-hunter_) aramalarında da çıkmanızı sağlayacaktır.

**Önerilenler**

Her 2-3 günde bir LinkedIn'e girip İngiltere'de bana önerilen pozisyonlara bakıyordum, algoritmaya bir miktar güvenebiliyoruz.

**Alarm oluşturmak**

Linkedin email alarmlarımı açtım. Fakat direkt Linkedin'in önerilen alarmlarını kabul ederseniz onların sonuçları fazla genel oluyor. Çok fazla işe yaramaz pozisyon gösterdiği için bir noktadan sonra can sıkıcı olmaya başlıyor. Ben bana uygun pozisyonları filtreleyerek bazı aramalar oluşturdum ve bu aramalara özel email alarmlarını aktifleştirdim. Bir kaç spesifik aramaya özel alarmlarım vardı (Genel yazılım vs. yapay zeka etc). Böylece yeni pozisyonlar çıktıkça haberim oluyordu.


Aramalarımızı detaylandırmak için kullanabileceğimiz girdilere bir bakalım:

1. 🟢 **Text Query**: This is the query you search for initially when you begin your LinkedIn search. I had alerts with the query field set to `Software`, `Data Scientist`, `Machine Learning`. This field will depend on your specialisation but it is always wise to have one with `Software` to cover most bases.
2. 🟢 **Date Posted**: Best to keep this in line with your alert's period. i.e. if you have daily alarms, include last 24 hours.
3. 🟢 **Location**: This is a safe field an mostly used well by companies. My searches were almost all confined to United Kingdom. You can have a set of cities, or countries, or economic zones (i.e. European Union).
4. 🔴 **Experience Level**: This is an unsafe field for LinkedIn searches as it is often not respected by companies putting out these job adverts. If you filter to say, `Entry Level`, there is a high probability that you will miss on a lot of opportunities so I suggest not using this field.
5. 🟠 **Company**: This is a field I used for defining different sets of alerts. I had a 24h period alert spanning FAANG-adjacent companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and the likes of Twitter, JPMorgan, Bloomberg, Yelp, SkyScanner etc.) and a weekly alarm with an unset company field so I could track all openings.
6. 🔴 **On-site/Remote**: I suggest not using this field as it also tends to be subject to erroneous use.
7. 🔴 **Easy Apply**: I marked easy apply as a red field because I haven't really had anyone contact me from the Easy Apply applications I have made. If you do see an Easy Apply opening, I suggest checking out the company's Hiring page on their official website. Only use Easy Apply if they don't have any opening adverts they are hosting themselves.
8. 🔴 **Industry**: I don't suggest filtering based on this field as companies in different industries may offer well-paid and well-established SWE positions. Say the likes of Bloomberg. You may wish to use this if you're targeting specific high-salary industries like Finance.
9. 🔴 **Job title**: I don't suggest filtering based on this field if your alert is not confined. to tech industry companies.
10. 🔴 **Salary**: Again a not well-respected field by hiring managers and is also frequently left blank so do not use this if you don't want to miss out on opportunities.

**Profile**

Goes without saying that you should **keep your profile up-to-date**. Make sure to add descriptions to your previous and current positions to rank higher in keywords for recruiters. Recruiter mail may feel like spam, but they are people who are trying to get a paycheck by getting someone hired, so follow them and get in touch if you see a potential opening.

### 2.2 Company websites

You must subscribe to **job opening alerts** by your target companies that are hiring at high volumes. This covers any big tech.

Some examples:

- [Meta careers](https://www.metacareers.com/)
- [Amazon jobs](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/)
- [Google careers](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/)

Most companies do have **mailing lists** you can subscribe to, make sure to do so to not miss out.

### 2.3 How to find companies that offer visa sponsorship

Not all companies offer visa sponsorship. And not all companies that do have the ability to offer visa sponsorship do so in all their positions.

What I did for applying to non-big-tech companies was using the following website to track visa sponsors:

![UK Tier Sponsors website screenshot](uktiersponsors.png)

Link: [UK Tier Sponsors](https://uktiersponsors.co.uk/). If that seems broken, take a look at https://uk-sponsors.dutl.uk.

This is a comprehensive list of companies that are eligible to offer visa sponsorship.

I used this website in two ways:

1. Checking if companies I am applying through LinkedIn adverts are registered here.

2. Going through literally all entries in this web app and opening their websites in new tabs, one page at a time. Then I would go through all websites to see if there are any openings, apply if yes, look for open positions in LinkedIn if not, and would apply to everything I could find. 

P.S. if you're going for the 2nd option, filtering by industry might help reduce your wasted time.

Apparently they have also added a saved list, slack community, and an option to export the list, and most recent additions to the list which could be useful (mental note to myself for hooking this data up to a mailing list) and did not exist at my time of using this app.

### 2.4 Sharing is caring

It's good to have alerts and such, but it's even better when the adverts pass through a human filter. If you're a collaborative soul, find or form instant messaging **groups, message boards** where people share open positions in their company.

### 2.5 Before you apply

**Referrals**

Before you apply to a company's opening check in with your contacts. If you know someone from that company that you worked together with, or, took part in activities relating to software development with, reach out to them before you apply to the position. 

Most companies provide a referral program, where their employees can vouch for people they have experience working with. The person you reach out to can send you a referral link through which you can apply to the position of your choice. This will place you higher in the queue of people to be interviewed and potentially help you get hired.

It is important to keep in mind that most companies don't let you add a reference to your application after you sibmit it. So make sure you get your referral before you apply.

## 3. Steps of the hiring process

The hiring process usually has the following steps (steps 2 & 3 may occasionally be swapped):

1. Online Assessment (OA)
2. Phone-Screen Interview
3. Recruiter Call
4. On-site Interview

### 3.1 Online Assessment

Usually the first step of the interviewing process, the OA usually comprises of two coding questions that you can solve at an allocated 45-60 minutes of your choosing.

One should keep in mind that unfortunately, having a 100/100 score on these questions won't guarantee that you will advance to the next step.

### 3.2 Phone-Screen Interview

In this step you solve your questions by demonstrating your thought process to an engineer, walking them through the process.

Reaching this step means you are officially going through the interview process. You have passed a CV-review and have demonstrated skill in solving coding problems. 

This is the first step you meet with an engineer from the company, and get to ask questions. Depending on the company you may get asked behaviorals questions. In which case refer to the STAR method.

### 3.3 Recruiter Call

You get a call from the recruiter, where they walk you through next steps. You may sometimes be asked small questions based on your skills for them to delegate you to one of the open positions with the title you've applied for.

### 3.4 On-site Interview

On-site interviews are traditionally done by inviting over the candidate to the office of the position. The candidate's accommodation and travel is reimbursed. There, they go through 3 to 5 interviews back to back. These are usually 45 minute phone screen style interviews with 15 minutes of breaks inbetween (or 55-5). I heard they make you write code on a whiteboard! Personally, I went through online on-sites as I was applying through Covid.

### 3.5 Additional notes

This process can slightly change depending on the company you are interviewing with. For example Palantir has a contractor firm that does their phone interviews for them. So you won't be meeting a Palantir engineer during your phone interview.

Another thing Palantir does differently is that the onsite is not the final step. There, you also go through a manager call (which I didn't progress to). Where the hiring manager decides if you're a good fit for them.

## 4. My Experience with the hiring process

Whilst I was going through the interviewing process, I wanted to keep track of everything and keep some statistics on how it was going. 
For this, I started keeping an excel sheet. I kept the _company name, position, level, application date, location, interview steps_ and a little progress bar for some pizazz.

![An excel sheet where I had tracked my interviewing process](tracking-dashboard-2.png)

I also keep notes to track what went well and what could be improved. Getting back to this info later and addressing improvement opportunities is extremely useful.

If you need a little estimate of what it took for me to land my job offer; I applied for 202 separate positions in 80 days. You can see a small summary of how my job hunt went in the numbers below.

![Some statistics from my interviewing process. 202 Applied, 18 OAs, 9 recruiter calls, 4 phone interviews, 2 onsites, 1 offer, 82 rejects](tracking-dashboard-stats.png){style="max-width: min(500px, 100%);"}

## 5. My experience getting hired by Amazon

Interestingly, out of the 202 positions I have applied to, the position I went forward with and received an offer from was through my first ever application.

I had applied to Amazon and interviewed with them 2 years prior for an internship role. My experience was **very positive**, but as it goes, I was underprepared and failed the phone screen interview. 

Then as I was looking for a job 2 years later, **Amazon was the first company I applied to**. I had applied for a non-student position. I **managed to progress** through the **OA**, the **phone screen interview** and the **recruiter call** so they had me pick a date for the onsite interview. When nobody was confirming the date I picked T minus 2 days, I reached out to everyone I could to find out that **the position I had applied for was already filled**, and the opening was to be closed.

Disheartened, I explained that as a senior year student I was able to pass through this interview process and that I believed this shows potential and skill. I explained that I would like my process to be counted towards a graduate role. I pushed for this and tried to add grease to the communication between recruiters and hiring managers by asking for updates as least intrusively as I could but still frequently. 

I was given the green light and was told to wait for a certain recruiter to reach out. A month later when student programs started receiving applications, I had my **onsite interview** over Amazon Chime and received **an offer within 5 days**.

I guess my lesson learned from this would be to not be afraid to **inquire about additional opportunities** even if you do get rejected. Asking can't hurt.

![A tv screen with Amazon Chime running](amazon-chime.png){style="max-width: min(500px, 100%);"}

The Amazon onsite is three back-to-back interviews for grad roles and 5 back-to-back interviews for non-grad roles. Every interviewer asks one behavioral question followed by a coding question or two. 

I can confidently say that Amazon's onsite was the onsite I found the most meaningful, due to the nature of the questions and how different they felt, from industry-standard leetcode questions. These were real business problems simplified into a 1-hour-ish problem, that didn't feel like neither an Introduction to Algorithms exam or a how-many-windows question.

After I joined the company I went through the hiring training as early as I could. When Amazon starts hiring, I will get to be on the other side of this process welcoming candidates and trying to give them their best interviewing experience :)

## 6. How to prepare for coding questions?

Not going to lie, coding questions aren't easy. There are some things you can do to get better at it.

### 6.1 Read some Cracking the Coding Interview

Might be a little bit old school, but I definitely suggest you start by reading `Cracking the Coding Interview` which I read in a nice little motel down in Şile before an interview. This should give you more than just how to solve questions. It gives very good pointers about how to create a good CV and a lot of other points as well.

I would suggest reading it selectively, skipping stuff you already know about.

### 6.2 Solving LeetCode problems

Go to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and create an account if you haven't done so.

I am not one to give advice on this part probably, because my methodology was extremely painful. I would try to solve 2 questions a day, without consulting outside sources. It would take me between 20 minutes to 2 hours to solve one question. So. I spent 40 minutes to several hours every day. 

Instead what I should have done was applying my battle-tested study technique that I used when preparing for national placement exams, adapted to this new domain.

**The technique**

Solve three questions a day. **Do not spend more than 10 minutes without progress**. If you can't progress, read solutions until you understand one fully and save the link to the question into a document with a date (call this the unsolved doc).

Next week, every day pick up one to three (depending on how long your list is) questions to solve from your unsolved doc. The ones you can solve, put them into a new document (call this the solved doc).

If you can't solve a question in your unsolved doc, add the number 1 next to the question. Read solutions, rinse & repeat.

If you are getting high numbers next to some questions, watch videos on them, re-implement solutions by reading, whatever helps it to stick. 

Every now and then, may be every month, go through your solved list. Try to see the solution to every question in your mind. If you can't, solve it again. If you can't, add it back to your unsolved list.

This ensures indefinite repetition of questions you can't solve and exerts less focus on the ones you can.

### 6.3 Finding company-specific questions

Leetcode has question sets curated for interviewing at certain companies. However these lists are behind a paywall. I cam across lots of people who recommended I paid for a subscription to access these lists. You may want to do that if you have a bunch of money lying around. I chose to go a different way.

**Enter Lintcode Collections**

![A website in chinese](lintcode-collections.png)

**LintCode** is basically a Chinese **LeetCode clone**. You don't need to create an account although it helps get rid of annoying prompts.

LintCode collections have separate **collections of questions in the style of specific companies**. I used LintCode collections when interviewing with Twitter and Facebook. If you know a bit of Mandarin you can go a long way on LintCode. If not, you can use any translation extension to explore questions. 

Mind you, these are not special questions you can't find anywhere, but questions _lists_ curated for companies. If you want to better keep track of your progress, you can look through the lists, then find and solve the question on LeetCode. That is what I did, primarily because at the time LintCode did not support community solutions, whereas LeetCode did.

## 7. How to prepare for behavioral questions?

Behavioral questions are questions where the interviewer asks the interviewee questions regarding how they behaved in certain scenarios in the workplace. If you're a student and have no work experience, you can resort to finding examples from group projects.

### 7.1 The STAR method

On how to answer these questions: just go ahead and search for the STAR method. This is the industry standard for answering behavioral questions. In a nutshell you can use STAR to tell a story by laying out the Situation, Task, Action, and Result. 

- **Situation**: Set the scene and give the necessary details of your example.
- **Task**: Describe what your responsibility was in that situation.
- **Action**: Explain exactly what steps you took to address it.
- **Result**: Share what outcomes your actions achieved.

It is best not to try and form these stories on the whim. It really does take a few interviews to get how to do this right. 

### 7.2 Leadership principles

I really do suggest going and having a read on **Amazon's LPs**. They are good **tenets** on which you can build your work ethics. LPs are actually applicable industry-wide and it is good to have stories matching Amazon's LPs even if you're interviewing somewhere else.

The 16 current leadership principles are in no particular order:

1. Customer Obsession
2. Ownership
3. Invent and Simplify
4. Are Right, A Lot
5. Learn and Be Curious
6. Hire and Develop the Best
7. Insist on the Highest Standards
8. Think Big
9. Bias for Action
10. Frugality
11. Earn Trust
12. Dive Deep
13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
14. Deliver Results
15. Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer
16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

I suggest going and having a read of [Amazon's Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles) in greater detail.

### 7.3 How to prepare your answers

During my interviewing process, I curated a list of behavioral questions from a bunch of companies. I added stories from my experience in the STAR method to some key questions. For others, a story from another question could be reused. I left these blank. I matched these question-story pairs with related Leadership Principles (LPs). See below some example pages from the document I kept;

![Two pages showing behavioral questions. Some are answered in the star format while some are left blank](behavioral-star.png)

I had also created a small tool to practice interview questions. This tool has a default set of questions that it displays on the screen. You have 30 seconds to think about each question, and 90 seconds to recite your answer. The tool takes no input, only provides you questions and a timer.

![A tool to practice behavioral questions with a timer](behavioral-practice-tool.png)

Here's a link to the rather 00s looking tool: [Behavioral Interview Practice](https://behavioral-interview-practice.dutl.uk)

## 8. How to get better at interviewing

> A tourist asked a New Yorker how do you get to Carnegie Hall. And the answer was: Practice! Practice! Practice!

It goes without saying that you should practice the whole interviewing process. For this you should get interviewed.
As you go through interviews at companies, you will get more practice. You should take notes after every interview on what went well and what could be improved.

However, you might not get a lot of interviews and not want to spend first few interviews making errors, or, you might want to get mock interviews.

**Mock interviews**

In my case, as I applied to a whole lot of companies I got to interview at a lot of places. In the meantime, me and my friends who were also looking for a job (and ones who did find oen) at the time had a WhatsApp group. Prior to interviews or interview seasons we would write and ask if someone could mock-interview us.

Other people would join in to shadow as well. So you would be interviewing with a friend or acquaintance, in English, with a bunch of others watching. It closely replicates the _Stage fright_ aspect of the interviewing process. Which helps calm you down in consecutive interviews.

If you don't have (such) friends, you can check out peer mock interview services. These are web apps that match two people who want to practice the two sides of the interviewing process. Examples TBA.

## 9. Conclusion

This sums up the tools and techniques I have used to secure a Software Engineering position in the UK as a Turkish citizen. This is not meant to be a definitive guide, but offers perspective from someone who has been through the process in a rather short time. I hope having read this, you have learned a thing or two you did not know about or gained a realistic perspective on what it takes to conclude a job hunt.

Mind you, this document has no mention of the Global Talent or Global Promise visa schemes, which completely remove the need for finding a company that can sponsor your visa. I have friends going through this process. I am trying to get them to write up a small document describing that process as well. If I succeed, I'll add a link to their post here.
