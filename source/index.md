## About
I'm Cemre from Istanbul. Currently living in London, UK where I work as a computer engineer. Check out my [cv](/cv)!

I founded an e-learning platform, [Lisan](http://lisan.dutl.uk), to help communities preserve their cultural languages. 

I have experience in Deep Learning and Machine Learning projects in academia and work professionally with a focus on Network Infrastructure and distributed systems. 

Currently, I'm working on developing networking solutions for Amazon Prime Video to handle millions of transactions with low latency and high availability.

## Hobbies
When I'm not working, I enjoy immersing myself in new languages. Currently, I'm working on improving my Korean. 

Another thing I like to engage in is photography, both digital and analog. I love being able to capture moments in the medium of images. Although I haven't been able to pursue this hobby as much as I'd like recently, I'm hoping to make more time for it soon.

I like reading about retro tech, digital and analog tech history. I love discussing alternative networks, sustainable software development. Lately thinking a lot about minimising addiction & distraction, promoting positive interactions and user-centered design around social spaces and applications.
