## About Me

I'm Cemre, a computer engineering graduate from Boğaziçi University with a keen interest in linguistics and languages. I have experience working on Deep Learning and Machine Learning projects and I'm currently working as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. My recent work has focused on Network Infrastructure and distributed systems. You can check out some of my past projects on the [projects](/projects/projects) tab.

## Hobbies

Apart from my professional pursuits, I also enjoy learning new languages and currently, I'm working on improving my French and Korean. I'm also passionate about analog and digital photography, though I haven't been able to pursue this hobby as much as I'd like recently.
