## About me

Software Engineer living in London, writing on software, retro tech, mindful social media, and languages. I'm a geek and an overthinker. I'm a traveller and a poetry enjoyer.

I founded [lisan](http://lisan.dutl.uk) to help minority language preservation.

I procrastinate by working on [small web-apps](https://www.dutl.uk/).
