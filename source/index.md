## Hey

My name is [Cemre](https://forvo.com/word/cemre/#tr). Welcome to my space on the web.

I am a programmer & software engineer from Turkey, Istanbul. I have been living in London, UK for 2~ years. I write on my blog about life in the UK, my travels, hobbies, projects, finances, life in general.

I like reading about retro tech, digital and analog tech history. I love discussing alternative social web structures, sustainable software development. Lately thinking a lot about minimising addiction & distraction, promoting positive interactions and user-centered design around social spaces and applications.

I founded an e-learning platform, [Lisan](http://lisan.dutl.uk), to help communities preserve and revive their cultural languages. I also launched a now-offline slow social media application called Untitled Diary App. 

Currently, I'm working on developing a new product for Rippling, a very cool startup developing the best centralized HR solution on the market.

Make sure to check out the [blog](blog) tab or [archive](/archive) to learn about what I'm working on. If you are interested in hiring me, check out my [cv](/cv).
