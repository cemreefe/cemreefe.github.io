## About Me
I'm Cemre, a computer engineering graduate with a passion for linguistics and language technology. I founded an e-learning platform, [Lisan](http://lisan.dutl.uk), to help communities preserve their cultural languages. I have experience in Deep Learning and Machine Learning projects in academia and work professionally with a focus on Network Infrastructure and distributed systems. Currently, I'm working on developing networking solutions for Amazon Prime Video to handle millions of transactions with low latency and high availability.

## Hobbies
When I'm not working, I enjoy immersing myself in new languages and cultures. Currently, I'm working on improving my French and Korean. I'm also passionate about photography, both digital and analog. I love being able to capture moments and tell stories through images. Although I haven't been able to pursue this hobby as much as I'd like recently, I'm hoping to make more time for it soon.
