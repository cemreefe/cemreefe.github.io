				<p>My name is Cemre, I am a Computer Engineering Bachelor @ Boğaziçi University in Istanbul. I was born in '98 as a Turkish citizen. In my second year in College I became interested in Machine Learning and its applications. I attended a deeplearning.ai study group at Inzva and took part in AI projects. I did my internship on Machine Learning at Tazi AI and I am currently studying GANs at the Turkish hacker community Inzva.</p>
				<p>My interests outside my field include languages, analog photography, analog collages, illustration & animation.</p>

				</div>

				<p><b>Tazi AI (3 months in 2019)</b></p>
				<p>Machine Learning Intern. I implemented a Gaussian Process Regressor that is online trainable,  and is limited in size by a smart budget management. This Regressor was integrated to Tazi's main product that serves as a user-friendly Machine Learning platform. I have mainly used Scala throughout my internship.</p>

				<p><b>Inzva (2018-Present)</b></p>
				<p>Attended the 16 weeks long <i>deeplearning.ai study group</i> as a participant.</p>
				<p>Participated in <i>AI Projects 3</i> in which we took on the earthquake prediction problem proposed on kaggle. We tried to modify a Trigger-Word Detection model structure to work in said problem and managed to get decent results.</p>
				<p>Participated in <i>AI Projects 4</i> as a project lead. We implemented SketchyGAN's MRU layer in keras and experimented with different applications of the model. We imitated the results of the paper and learned a lot about how GANs work in the process.</p>
