<b>Introduction</b>
<p>Ever felt frustrated when a chatbot loses context after you explore a side topic? Current LLM (Large Language Model) conversation models are limited by their linear structure, which hinders context preservation and flexibility in branching and merging conversations. To overcome this, I propose a graph-managed LLM conversation approach, allowing for broader discussions with specific side topics while maintaining the full context.</p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>

<b>What is immutability?</b>
<p>Immutability is a concept in computer science and programming that refers to the property of an object or data structure being unable to be modified or changed after it is created. In immutable systems, once an object is created, its state cannot be altered. Instead, if a change is needed, a new object or data structure is typically created with the desired changes, leaving the original object unchanged. Immutability is often valued for its benefits in maintaining data integrity, simplifying code, and enhancing concurrency in multi-threaded applications. Immutable objects are commonly used in functional programming and in scenarios where predictability and consistency are crucial.</p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>

<p>Introducing Emoji.dutl.uk: A Simple Website that Serves Emojis as Images</p>
<p>Emojis have become a part of our daily communication on social media, messaging apps, and other digital platforms. However, when you need the emoji in image format, you might have to follow several steps to obtain a usable image. That's where Emoji.dutl.uk comes in.</p>
<p>As the creator of Emoji.dutl.uk, I wanted a simple solution to serve emojis as images on my websites. I found it tedious to create an image file for each emoji, so I created this website to solve that problem. It's a static website that serves emojis as <code>.png</code> files, making it easy to use them as favicons.</p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>

<p>In this project, we implemented SketchyGAN, an image-to-image GAN model that allowed for non-pixel-to-pixel transformations which was novel at the time. We followed the SketchyGAN paper and implemented the model in Keras instead of TensorFlow as the paper did.</p>
<p>Read about our project from inzva:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having graduated from the ‚Äújunior position‚Äù they were assigned to in the previous batch of AI Projects, undergraduates from Boƒüazi√ßi University, Cemre Efe Karaka≈ü and Eyl√ºl Yal√ßƒ±nkaya, along with another undergraduate from Istanbul Technical University, Burak Bek√ßi, a previous participant in our Applied AI Study Group, had one of the most acclaimed presentations in AI Projects history as they showcased a very fun way to implement GANs by turning their faces into sketches. </p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to convert a sketch image into an actual image. A GAN architecture is used since this is an image-to-image translation problem. The team first wanted to replicate the results of their reference paper, SketchyGAN [1]. This special GAN architecture contains the masked residual unit (MRU) as a novel component. Apart from the traditional convolutions and the features obtained from them, MRU layer takes downsampled and upsampled versions of the actual images as input during the encoding and decoding part in the generator. Apart from this novel architecture, SketchyGAN also use extra loss terms added to the original GAN loss, such as perceptual loss and diversity loss. The team showed their results by also presenting their own sketches translated into actual images. </p>

<a class="previewHref" href="posts/2019/07/08/Predicting-Earthquakes-Using-Trigger-Word-Detection-Algorithms"><div><div class="preview-title"><b>Earthquake time-to-failure prediction using a trigger word detection algorithm</b></div>
<p>In this project, we aimed to explore the feasibility of using trigger word detection models to predict earthquakes. We were fortunate to have the guidance and expertise of a senior engineer from Is Bankasi, who provided valuable insights and guidance throughout the project. This project was part of Inzva's Applied AI Projects, which aims to give hands-on experience to aspiring data scientists and machine learning engineers.</p>
<p>To accomplish our goal, we used Andrew Ng's trigger word detection model, which is a widely used approach in the field of natural language processing. We adapted this model to listen to audio recordings of seismic activity continuously and output a higher value when the waveform suggests that the last waves might have been formed by the trigger word. Our hypothesis was that the preceding waves in the recording could provide information about the time to failure, allowing us to predict an earthquake.</p>
<p>We were excited to participate in a Kaggle competition where we applied our model to predict the timing of earthquakes based on seismic activity. The competition was a challenge, as we were working with a large dataset of around 610 million points, making data processing and training time-consuming. Despite these challenges, our team was able to place in the top 11% of participants, which was a great achievement for our first deep learning project.</p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>
